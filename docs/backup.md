## Backing up MySQL and MongoDB data on a multi-node stack

In `playbooks/openstack` you'll find a `backup.yml` playbook that will take
consistent Cinder snapshots of the MySQL and MongoDB volumes of backend
instances, and also rotate them to a configurable limit.  It's designed to run
very quickly, in a non-disruptive manner so as not to incur any downtime for
users.

It is meant to be run from the `deploy` node of a multi-node Heat stack, with
OpenStack authentication variables properly set.  See
`playbooks/openstack/group_vars/backend_servers.example` for a list of
variables that must be changed, including the number of snapshots that will be
maintained in rotation for each instance and database.

It is recommended that this playbook be run with:

    --limit <secondary_backend_node>

With the sample multi-node Heat template, it would either be `--limit
192.168.122.112` or `--limit 192.168.122.113`.  It should not be targetted on
the primary backend node (`192.168.122.111`), because in order to get a
consistent snapshot, prior to snapshotting it will stop the MariaDB service and
sync the filesystem.  (MongoDB doesn't require special handling due to the fact
that its journal is stored in the same volume as the database being
snapshotted.)

Note: the snapshot script expects the backend Cinder volume names to follow a
certain pattern: the MySQL volume must contain "mysql_data" in its name, and
the MongoDB one must contain "mongodb_data".  The provided multi-node Heat
template follows this precise pattern.

### Automating the backup

To run the backup playbook on a schedule, create a cron file such as
`/etc/cron.d/backup`.  If you wish to run the backup daily at 01:05 AM, for
example, copy the following lines into the file:

```
# /etc/cron.d/backup: cron entry for backups

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
HOME=/home/ubuntu

05 1 * * * ubuntu cd /var/tmp/edx-configuration/playbooks; ansible-playbook -i openstack/inventory.py openstack/backup.yml --limit 192.168.122.112 2>&1 >> /var/log/backup.log
```

You'll find a sample `backup.cron` in `playbooks/openstack`, alongside the
backup playbook.

You will also need to create an SSH key without a passphrase for the ubuntu
user on the deploy node, and distribute it to the other nodes.   This is so
that Ansible can connect to the backend node without human intervention.  (You
can skip this step if you've already done it as part of initial stack
deployment.)

```sh
# Create a new key pair
export KEYFILE=~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f $KEYFILE

# Disable strict host key checking
echo "StrictHostKeyChecking no" > ~/.ssh/config

# Deploy it
ips=$(~/edx-configuration/playbooks/openstack/inventory.py --list | grep 192 | tr -d ' ",')
for ip in $ips; do
    ssh-keyscan $ip >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    ssh-copy-id -i $KEYFILE $ip
done
```
