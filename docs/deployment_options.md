# Deployment options

You can use the Heat templates to deploy either a single-node or a
multi-node edX environment.

- In a single-node environment, all Open edX services run on the same
  Nova instance. This configuration is recommended for
  proof-of-concept environment, or when you want to quickly spin up an
  edX stack on your OpenStack cloud for testing or evaluation
  purposes.
- In a multi-node environment, Heat deploys a three-node backend
  cluster running MySQL and MongoDB in a high-availability
  configuration. It also deploys a configurable number of application
  servers running all other Open edX services, and puts all
  application servers behind a load balancer.
